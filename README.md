# AI Government Scheme Eligibility Assistant
Status: Design Phase | Hackathon Submission

A conversational AI system designed to help Indian citizens identify government welfare schemes they are eligible for through intelligent profile-based matching.

Developed as part of the AI for Bharat Hackathon, this project focuses on improving accessibility to public welfare programs by simplifying discovery and reducing language and usability barriers.

## Overview

Access to government schemes remains a challenge for millions due to fragmented information, complex portals, and limited regional language support. This system addresses that gap through a guided chatbot experience that recommends relevant schemes based on user attributes.

The platform prioritizes simplicity, privacy, and inclusivity while remaining scalable for broader public deployment.
